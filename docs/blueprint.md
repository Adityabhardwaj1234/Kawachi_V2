## Core Features:

- Visual Replica: Faithful pixel-perfect and responsive recreation of the reference website, ensuring visual accuracy across all devices.
- Animated Interactions: Animated transitions using Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions for a dynamic user experience, with scroll and hover animations on relevant components.
- Responsive Navigation: Functional navigation with a desktop navbar and a scrollable mobile hamburger menu that transforms on click.
- Interactive Elements: Interactive elements such as FAQ accordions with animated arrow rotations and functional (but mocked) subscription form.
- Ripple Effect: Ripple click effect for desktop interactions (implemented via canvas or SVG).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) to evoke a sense of trust and technological advancement.
- Background color: Very light teal (#F0F8FF) providing a subtle and clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Blue-green (#00A36C), brighter than the primary color, used for calls to action.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, chosen for its readability and modern appeal, making it suitable for both headings and body text.
- Use clean, modern icons that align with the theme of engineering and infrastructure. Icons should have a slight glowing effect to match button styles.
- Maintain a consistent grid layout to ensure proper spacing and alignment. Use real units (not auto-sized fillers) for precision.
- Subtle scroll-triggered animations for section reveals and staggered animations for cards in the projects section to draw user attention.
